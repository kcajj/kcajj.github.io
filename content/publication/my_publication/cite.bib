  abstract  = "Bacteriophages, the viruses that infect bacteria, are
               the most abundant and diverse biological entities on our planet.
               They play a critical role in shaping ecosystems and are
               increasingly recognized for their potential in treating
               bacterial infections. Yet, our comprehension of their biology
               and evolutionary dynamics is limited, largely because research
               has concentrated on a select few well-characterized phages or
               relies on broad metagenomic studies with limited follow-up
               analysis of individual phages. This knowledge gap hinders our
               capacity to exploit their therapeutic and ecological
               possibilities -- and while some studies have attempted to bridge
               it, such efforts typically require a lot of manual labor,
               highlighting the need for high-throughput, reproducible methods
               for in-depth study of phage evolution.To address this gap, we
               introduce the Aionostat, a novel automated continuous culture
               device designed to facilitate bacteriophage directed evolution
               experiments at scale. The Aionostat's potential is showcased
               through two example experiments. In the first, phages from the
               BASEL collection rapidly adapted to a challengingE. colistrain,
               acquiring mutations and deletions that improved their
               infectivity. In the second experiment, we evolved a mixture of
               these phages on the sameE.colistrain, leading to the emergence
               of recombinant phages with increased fitness. By automating
               these experiments, the Aionostat enables faster, more
               reproducible studies of phage evolution that would be
               impractical to perform by hand, thereby opening new avenues for
               investigating viral dynamics, engineering phage therapies, and
               studying evolutionary principles in broader biological contexts.",
